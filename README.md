# 👋 Hi there! I'm Nikita

I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on **Python**, especially:
- ⚡️ FastAPI
- ⛃ SQLAlchemy
- 🛡️ Pydantic
- 🔀 AsyncIO

Currently learning **React** ⚛️ to level up on the frontend side.

🎯 Working on a personal project to manage **personal finances** — blending code with money smarts.

Always up for solving meaningful problems and building things that make life easier 🚀

Let's connect!
